# Translational Impact

My work is driven by the question of how inflammatory and metabolic pathways can be **therapeutically modulated** to prevent or reverse liver injury.

## Therapeutic questions addressed
- Why cholestatic liver injury fails to resolve despite removal of initiating stressors
- How macrophage polarization states shape inflammation and tissue injury
- Where nuclear receptor signaling can be leveraged for intervention

## From mechanism to intervention
My research has evaluated therapeutic mechanisms involving:
- **FXR and LRH-1 signaling** in cholestatic and inflammatory liver disease
- **STAT3 and STAT6 activation** as protective pathways
- Epigenetic regulation of inflammatory and metabolic states
- **Small-molecule agonists and dietary lipid approaches** as modulators of disease biology

## Outputs
- Peer-reviewed publications supporting mechanism-informed intervention strategies
- Funded translational projects and pilot grants
- Conference presentations communicating translational relevance
