# Research

My research focuses on inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms underlying liver disease, with an emphasis on therapeutic modulation and translational relevance.

## Inflammatory cholangiopathies & cholestasis
- Parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis (PNAC) and cholangiopathy models
- Inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, senescence, and tissue injury

## Macrophage biology in liver inflammation
- Hepatic macrophage polarization and functional states
- Crosstalk between immune signaling and hepatobiliary homeostasis

## Nuclear receptor signaling
- FXR and LRH-1 in hepatobiliary homeostasis and inflammatory control
- Integration with STAT signaling (STAT3/STAT6) and pathway readouts

## Epigenetic regulation and metabolism
- Epigenetic regulators shaping inflammatory programs
- Metabolic adaptation in inflammatory disease contexts
