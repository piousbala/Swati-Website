# Swati Ghosh, PhD

**Translational Liver Disease Scientist**  
Inflammation • Nuclear Receptor Signaling • Epigenetic Regulation

I study inflammatory liver disease with the goal of identifying **mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies**. My work integrates nuclear receptor signaling, macrophage biology, epigenetic regulation, and small-molecule or dietary interventions across preclinical models of cholestatic and metabolic liver disease.

My research has addressed conditions including **parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis**, **primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)**, and **metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)**, with emphasis on FXR, LRH-1, STAT3/STAT6, and macrophage-mediated inflammatory pathways.
